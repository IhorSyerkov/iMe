Changelog:

V00.00.01.08 August X, 2016

	* Continually checks if accelerometer and heater are working while they're being used
	* Prevents moving higher than the initial starting point when moving to Z0
	* Allows setting the jerk sensitivity for homing in the EEPROM
	* Fixed potential issue that can occur when interrupts read/write to the EEPROM or multibyte global variables
	* Prevents the M618 and M619 from reading/writing to the firmware decryption table in the EEPROM

V00.00.01.06 July 28, 2016

	* First non-alpha release of iMe. Huge thanks to everyone who contributed!
	* Compiled with the latest Atmel Software Framework V3.32
	* Uses intrinsic delays
	* Fixed accumulating rounding error that occurs due moving a fractional number of steps
	* Decreased homing accelerometer sensitivity
	* Allows setting the steps/mm for each of the motors

V00.00.00.12 July 20, 2016

	* Sped up movements
	* No longer adjusts the motor E current since it might be putting too much stress on the motor when no filament is present and when the nozzle is clogged
	* Compiled with the latest Atmel AVR 8-bit Toolchain V3.5.3 and Atmel Software Framework V3.31
	* Fixed issue where the bed orientation version in the printer's EEPROM would be updated after running a G32 command
	* Sets unused pins as inputs with pull-up resistors enabled

V00.00.00.10 June 16, 2016

	* Fixed compatibility with MatterControl
	* M33 Manager includes button to install M3D firmware

V00.00.00.09 June 1, 2016

	* Fixed compatibility with Simplify3D and Repetier-Host
	* M33 Manager now allows switching to bootloader mode
	* Added delays to allow voltages to stabilize before reading them with the ADC

V00.00.00.08 May 25, 2016

	* Decreased homing accelerometer sensitivity
	* Added 'ok' response for M999 commands
	* First stable release of M33 Manager

V00.00.00.07 May 18, 2016

	* Prevents X and Y movements from going out of bounds
	* Writing to the EEPROM has been moved to a timer interrupt to reduce how much it bottlenecked the movement speed
	* Fixed serial port detection in the OS X version of M33 Manager

V00.00.00.06 May 12, 2016

	* Initial release
